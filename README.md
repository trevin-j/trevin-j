### Hey, I'm Trevin!

Iâ€™m a computer science student whoâ€™s all about software development while optimizing every aspect of my workflow. My terminal is where the magic happensâ€”Neovim, tmux, zsh, and a ton of other terminal apps, custom configurations, and plugins that complement my work and make everything flow *seamlessly*. ðŸ’»âœ¨

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on:
- **Languages**: Rust, Python, C#, and whatever catches my attention.
- **Tools**: Neovim, tmux, zsh, LazyGit, Hyprland, Arch Linux, and custom scripts and plugins that keep everything efficient. ðŸ”§
- **Projects**:
  - **Full-stack web app for a client**: Built with Rust, a chance to level up my skills and solve real problems. ðŸ’¥
  - **24 Hour Hackathon Project**: A Svelte + Flask app that optimizes student schedules based on course offerings and student needs. Worked with a team of 4, handled all the Svelte (learned to use it in only a few hours with no prior front-end experience) and data scraping, using constraint satisfaction. ðŸ’¡
  - **Personal Projects**: Constantly working on something new to push my limits and learn more. âš¡

Iâ€™m a huge lover of **open source** and **Linux** and environments that promote transparency and collaboration. If you're into optimizing workflows, Linux setups, or just building awesome software, letâ€™s connect.
